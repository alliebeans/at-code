# Alliebeans-Darker
### A Gray Theme with Cyan Accents for VS Code

This VS Code theme is based upon colors from the "Darker" theme in [alliebeans@debian](https://github.com/alliebeans/at-debian).

Very much personalized token colors, tweaked from [Ayu](https://vscodethemes.com/e/teabyii.ayu/ayu-dark).
This theme was inspired by [Greyboard](https://github.com/micjohansson/greyboard).
